title: Book Review, I came upon a lighthouse by Shantanu Naidu
---

I have been recently going to Crossword with my 6 year old daughter since she has picked up habbit of reading and during the last visit I picked up book titled I came upon a lighthouse by Shantanu Naidu. It's a book written by a 27 year old boy who founded an Startup named Motopaws and was in the media mainly because of his association with Mr. Ratan Tata

I picked up this book mostly to know a bit more about Mr. Ratan Tata. However, I really liked the way Shantanu has done the storytelling and introduced his Wit and humour between the lines. It was an easy read.

I found the charachter of Shantanu matching mine and thus got more interested in knowing more about his story. Alike him, I also went to US for the Master's and I always wanted to come back and I did come back shortly after completing my Master's.

It was great knowing more about the life of Mr. Ratan Tata and I love the way Shantanu has been honest about his relationship with him as it also went little bit sour at times.

Overall, it was a page turner for me and Illustrations in the book made it very very interesting.

I would defintely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a next easy read.
