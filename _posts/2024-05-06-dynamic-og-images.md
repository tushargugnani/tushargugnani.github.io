Recently I came across a new product by an indie maker [image.social](https://image.social), this product basically takes screenshot of your page 
and serves them as the og image for that page. So that each page of your application will have a dynamic og image

I was having a similar thought for one my website where-in I wanted to have a dynamic image for each of the page instead of the same image. Although 
the product is good It did not made sense to me pay a monthly subscription for something this simple.

I looked around an I found [Tailgraph](https://tailgraph.com/#try) , which basically uses tailwindcss to generate the desired formatted content for you,
along with borders, backgrounds etc. And then when you use the generated URL it serves the image from its own domain. That's Neat !

Now I have all pages serving dynamic og images on my website [blackfridaydeals.dev](https://blackfridaydeals.dev)
