Long back in my first organization they made us a book named Raving Fans. I loved the concept of the book and it absolutely made sense.
In brief the book talked about converting your customers into raving fans by delivering them what they expect and plus one. Basically going above and beyond of what the customers except and then doing something extra for them.

I have been working directly for clients as a software consultatnt for more than 10 years and I believe the above principle can be applied to any part of your life.

As a software developer here are a few things which can make sure you exceed the client's expectations. 

1. Whenever a task is assigned to you, make sure there is a way to notify client that you have taken a note of it and you'll be working on it. 
2. In case of urgent issues, I make sure to reply to the mail as soon as I read it, so that the client is aware that I am looking into the issue. 
3. After solving a issue or developing a feature always make sure to test it manually, no matter how trivial you think it is (I often miss on this point, so I need to work on this.)
4. Always try to include a few feature / unit test to go along with the issue / feature. Even though it hasnt been asked. You will often find a few edge cases while writing the tests which you forgot during the manual testing.
5. When submitting the code for review, try including a screencast of the demo of the feature you developed, so that the reviewer has a easier time navigating through the changes. 
6. If it's a UI Fix, include a screenshot of the change that you made.
